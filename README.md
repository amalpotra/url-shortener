<!-- ABOUT -->

## About

A RESTful API for shortening long links into more manageable and useable URLs.
For a URL, a 10 digit code is provided instead and the same is used to redirect back to the original one
and uses MongoDB for storing details.

### Made with
- [Express JS](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
- [Nano ID](https://github.com/ai/nanoid)

Look `package.json` for complete set of dependencies. 

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have.

- Node.js along with yarn package manager. If you do not have yarn, here is the official [guide](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) for that.
- A MongoDB connection string. (see MongoDB [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database))
- VS Code or any other code editor/IDE in place.

### Setup

So, this is how to set things up at local environment.

1. Clone the repo.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/amalpotra/url-shortener.git
   ```

2. Open with VS Code and navigate to `/configs` and create a new file named `config.env` and add these properties.
   ```env
   PORT = 3000
   BASE_URI = (optional)
   MONGO_URI = (your connection string)
   ```

4. Open terminal and run.

   ```sh
   yarn install
   yarn run dev
   ```

5. If everything went right, service would be available at `localhost:3000`.
